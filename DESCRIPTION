Description: ClonalSim generates realistic mutational profiles of tumor samples
    with hierarchical clonal structure. It simulates founder, shared, and private
    mutations with biologically realistic noise models including intra-tumor
    heterogeneity (Beta distribution) and technical sequencing noise (negative
    binomial depth variation, binomial read sampling, base errors). The package
    is designed for benchmarking variant callers, testing clonal deconvolution
    algorithms, and teaching tumor heterogeneity concepts.
